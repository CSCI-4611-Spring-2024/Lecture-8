# GopherGfx App Template

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js 20.11.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or newer) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

I also recommend you install the following useful VS Code extensions:

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (makes source control easier)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (static code analysis tool that can flag errors)
- [JavaScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly) (essential for real-time debugging)
- [WebGL GLSL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raczzalan.webgl-glsl-editor) (used for programming shaders later in the course)

- [GopherGfx Documentation](https://illusioneering.github.io/GopherGfx/)
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Your program should open in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
